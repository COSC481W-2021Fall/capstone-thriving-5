# The Thriving 5

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

## Project summary

A mobile app which will aim to help those suffering from a mental health crisis and will hopefully help to prevent a suicide. 
The app would provide information to licensed counselors, 24/7 hotlines, and emergency services. 
There would also be a feature showing nearby events supporting suicide prevention, links to donate to mental health causes, and ways someone can help. 
There would be a database for licensed professionals who are willing to volunteer their time for remote meetings with someone in immediate distress. 
If there are no licensed counselors nearby in the app and it is an emergency, a series of questions will help someone to determine which hotline is best to call,
or which hospital they can admit themselves into for the time being. 
A user database should have the option to create an account to schedule free remote counselling. 
Their account should also allow them to enter an emergency contact; A friend or family member who they can call/text. 
The app would also recommend calling their emergency contact as well as hotlines. 
A possible feature of this to be implemented could be the option for a user to send a predefined text or notification to their emergency contact.
